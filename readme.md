SOLID Design Principles
The SOLID acronym was coined by Michael Feathers and popularized by Robert Martin. Each letter stands for a well-known principle in object-oriented design. Here’s a formal definition of each one:

S - Single Responsibility
The methods in a class should be cohesive around a single purpose.

O - Open-Closed
Objects should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

L - Liskov Substitution
Subclasses should be substitutable for their superclasses.

I - Interface Segregation
Objects should not be forced to depend on methods they don’t use.

D - Dependency Inversion
Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.

If you find the above definitions less than enlightening, don’t despair. As principles are referenced in this book, plain language explanations (like the one below) will follow.
